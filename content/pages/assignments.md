**1)** **Short Essays**

Three short essays, one per "third" of the course, no more than 750 words or three pages long. The essays should critically examine a hypothesis, theory, question, concept or controversy contained in the readings for each week. The essay may address only a subset of the readings, but under no circumstances should the essay simply summarize assigned texts.

**2)** **Take-Home Exercise**

A take-home exercise is due at the end of the term. The question for the take-home will be distributed in class and will simulate the department's general exam in international relations.

**3)** **Research Abstracts**

Weekly research abstracts, no more than 300 words long will be based loosely on the topic or issues raised in discussion each week. These abstracts should state a hypothesis, outline its importance and describe how it might be tested. The abstracts are due within 24 hours after each meeting.
